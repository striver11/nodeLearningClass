1) Local Installation

        npm install <packageName>@versionNumber  --> if we are trying to install the specific versionNumber

        npm instll bootstrap@4.1.2   --> example

        npm install <packageName>  --> this will install the latest version of the packageName

        npm install bootstrap

2) Global Modules

        npm install -g <packageName>@versionNumber

        npm install -g <packageName>


we should not always do the Global installation because it may effect our local dependeny (package.json) file and
your entire application functionality

package.json  --> to create this we have to use  "npm init"
where you do "npm init"   --> i will ask questions  such as packag name,author,version etc
it will ask for package name: the package name should be always smaller case

if you don't want to questions to be asked use "npm init --yes"



Node App project structure
1)Main.js   (bootstrap file)
2)module.js (External JS file)
3)package.json  (Local dependeny information in maintained here)
4)node_modules   (installation directory for Local packages)
5)index.html  (view)
6)package.lock.json  (interdependecies are found here)



production dependencies we will use "npm install" this we can see in the "package.json"


dev dependencies we will use "npm install --save-dev jquery" this we can see in 





to see all packages locally  --> npm ls
to see all packages installed globally  -->npm list -g --depth=0


~3.0.5

it you want to see what packages are outdated in your project use --> "npm outdated"



after we deleted the node_modules if we want to install the node_modules again we use --> npm install
